# versions up to RT 3.8 use _Overlay files to separate generated code
# from core code, as such there are a lot of needless warnings about
# this.  These were removed in 4.0 so skipping this will not be required
#
# [Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef] 
# RT is documented to return undef in a number of places, and on a
# stable series I'm hesitant to go around changing to implicitly return
# undef.  We can clean this up in 4.0 and ensure that if something
# calling us in list context really needs that explicit undef, it
# doesn't break on a minor release upgrade.
#
# [Subroutines::RequireArgUnpacking]
# RT is a big user of my $self = shift; and will continue doing so
#

# 3.8 hasn't converted to using RT->SystemUser and the like and still reaches
# for RT:: in a lot of places.  Quiet that down with what seems like a slightly
# larger hammer than I would like.
