RTFM (The RT FAQ Manager) is a tool for maintaining an organizational
knowledgebase. Out of the box, it integrates with RT 3.4.2 or later
(Also available from bestpractical.com)

Best Practical sells support and customization for RT and RTFM.  Feel
free to contact us at sales@bestpractical.com if you have any
questions about our service offerings.

RTFM requires a few modules in addition to RT's standard dependencies.
The 'perl Makefile.PL' command will check that you have all of the
required modules installed; if not, they will either be auto-installed
during the 'make' step, or you can opt to install them by hand using
the CPAN shell or with any system-specific package management software
you may have.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

NOTE that upgrade steps are described below.

1) Install RT 3.4.2 or newer

2) Once RT appears to be happily installed, cd into the directory you
   unpacked RTFM into.

3) perl Makefile.PL

4) make install

5) make initdb

6) stop and start your web server

7) Before you can add content to RTFM articles, you will need to configure
   classes and custom fields. For details, see lib/RT/FM/Introduction.pod

Upgrade instructions (From any  2.0.x release):
-----------------------------------------------------

1) perl Makefile.PL

2) perl -I/path/to/your/rt/lib sbin/migrate-2.0-to-2.1

3) Type "make install"

4) Type "ls etc/upgrade"; For each item in that directory whose name
   is greater than your previously installed RTFM version, run:

            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action schema \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action acl \
                --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
            /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert \
                 --datadir etc/upgrade/<version>
