RTFM (The RT FAQ Manager) is a tool for maintaining an organizational
knowledgebase. Out of the box, it integrates with RT 3.4.2 or later
(Also available from bestpractical.com)

If you are running RT 4, you should not install RTFM.  RT 4.0.0 shipped
with Articles, which includes all of the functionality of RTFM along with
some new features.  If you were using RTFM with an older version of RTFM,
RT now contains upgrade instructions for migrating your data.

Best Practical sells support and customization for RT and RTFM.  Feel
free to contact us at sales@bestpractical.com if you have any
questions about our service offerings.

RTFM requires a few modules in addition to RT's standard dependencies.
The 'perl Makefile.PL' command will check that you have all of the
required modules installed; if not, they will either be auto-installed
during the 'make' step, or you can opt to install them by hand using
the CPAN shell or with any system-specific package management software
you may have.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------

NOTE that upgrade steps are described in UPGRADING

1) Install RT 3.4.2 or newer.
   Do not use this with 3.8.0 as there are incompatibilities.
   Any other release of RT 3.8 is fine.

2) Once RT appears to be happily installed, cd into the directory
   where you unpacked RTFM.

3) perl Makefile.PL

4) make install

5) make initdb

6) If you are running 3.8, you need to enable RTFM in your 
   RT_SiteConfig.pm file.  You can do this by adding the following
   line:

   Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::FM));

   If you already have a @Plugins line, you must add RT::FM to your
   existing plugin list.

7) Clear your mason cache.  This is most often accomplished with
   rm -rf /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/*

8) Stop and start your web server

9) Before you can add content to RTFM articles, you will need to configure
   classes and custom fields. For details, see lib/RT/FM/Introduction.pod

Development
------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to run RTFM's tests, you need to
set a few environment variables
RT_DBA_USER - a user who can create a database on your 
              RDBMS (such as root on mysql)
RT_DBA_PASSWORD - the password for RT_DBA_USER
PERL5LIB - the path to your RT libraries (/opt/rt3/lib)

RT_DBA_USER=user RT_DBA_PASSWORD=password PERL5LIB=/opt/rt3/lib make test

These are intended to be run before installing RTFM.
Like RT, RTFM expects to be able to create a new database called rt3test
on your system.
