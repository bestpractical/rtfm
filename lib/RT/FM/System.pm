=head1 NAME 

RT::FM::System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT::FM::System is a simple global object used as a focal point for things
that are system-wide.

It works sort of like an RT::Record, except it's really a single object that has
an id of "1" when instantiated.

This gets used by the ACL system so that you can have rights for the scope "RT::FM::System"

In the future, there will probably be other API goodness encapsulated here.

=cut

package RT::FM::System;
use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw /RT::Base/;

use vars qw/ $RIGHTS/;

use RT::ACL;


# Tell RT::ACE that this sort of object can get acls granted
$RT::ACE::OBJECT_TYPES{'RT::FM::System'} = 1;


# System rights are rights granted to the whole system
# XXX TODO Can't localize these outside of having an object around.
$RIGHTS = {
};


foreach my $right ( keys %{$RIGHTS} ) {
    $RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES{ lc $right } = $right;
}


=head2 AvailableRights

Returns a hash of available rights for this object. The keys are the right names and the values are a description of what the rights do

=cut

sub AvailableRights {
    my $self = shift;
    my $class = RT::FM::Class->new($RT::SystemUser);
    my $classrights = $class->AvailableRights();
    my $CustomField = RT::CustomField->new($RT::SystemUser);
    my $cfrights = $CustomField->AvailableRights();
    my %rights = (%{$cfrights}, %{$classrights});
    
    return(\%rights);
}


=head2 new

Create a new RT::FM::System object. Really, you should be using $RT::FM::System

=cut

                         
sub new {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
    my $self  = {};
    bless( $self, $class );


    return ($self);
}

=head2 id

Returns RT::FM::System's id. It's 1. 


=cut

*Id = \&id;

sub id {
    return (1);
}

=head2 Load

for compatibility. dummy method

=cut

sub Load {
    return(1);
}

=head2 ACLEquivalenceObjects

There are no rights granted globally from other objects

=cut

sub ACLEquivalenceObjects { } 

1;
