BUGS

 * Don't show articles twice. If we find an article by matching on the

   Custom Fields - falcone

   articles are found - falcone

  - jesse

  * Allow setting HotList on create - alexmv

 * If creation fails because of link creation, $ArticleObj->Id will be non-
   zero, as it *did* have a row in the article table -- even though it was
   rolled back. Forcing $ArticleObj to be fresh avoids a bug with
   EditCustomFields thinking the article actually existed, and hence not
   having a sticky value. - alexmv

 * Um, '=' != '0'; MySQL loves me too much, and let me get away with it -
   alexmv

 * Make tests pass again -- make the join not wrong
